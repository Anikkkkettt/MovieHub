                                crime film directed by Martin Scorsese and written by Terence Winter, based on the 2007
                                memoir of the same name by Jordan Belfort. It recounts Belfort's perspective
                                on his career as a stockbroker in New York City and how his firm, Stratton Oakmont,
                                engaged in rampant corruption and fraud on Wall Street, which ultimately led to his
                                downfall. Leonardo DiCaprio, who was also a producer
                                of the film, stars as Belfort, with Jonah Hill as his business partner and friend,
                                Donnie Azoff, Margot Robbie as his wife, Naomi Lapaglia, and Kyle Chandler as FBI agent
                                Patrick Denham, who tries to take Belfort down.

                                produced by Blue Sky Studios (in its debut film) and distributed by 20th Century Fox.
                                The film was directed by Chris Wedge (in his feature directorial debut) and co-directed
                                by
                                Carlos Saldanha from a screenplay by Michael Berg, Michael J. Wilson and Peter Ackerman
                                and a story by Wilson, and features the voices of Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, Denis
                                Leary, Goran Višnjić, and Jack Black. Set during the days of the Pleistocene ice age,
                                the film centers around three main characters—Manny (Romano), a no-nonsense woolly
                                mammoth; Sid (Leguizamo), a loudmouthed ground sloth; and Diego (Leary), a sardonic
                                saber-toothed cat—who come across a human baby and work together to return it to its
                                tribe.
                                Additionally, the film occasionally follows Scrat, a speechless "saber-toothed squirrel"
                                voiced by Wedge, who is perpetually searching for a place in the ground to bury his
                                acorn.

                            <p class="card-text">Pride & Prejudice is a 2005 romantic drama film directed by Joe Wright,
                                in his feature directorial debut, and based on Jane Austen's 1813 novel of the same
                                name. The film features five sisters from an English family of landed
                                gentry as they deal with issues of marriage, morality and misconceptions. Keira
                                Knightley stars in the lead role of Elizabeth Bennet, while Matthew Macfadyen plays her
                                romantic interest Mr. Darcy. Screenwriter Deborah Moggach
                                initially attempted to make her script as faithful to the novel as possible, writing
                                from Elizabeth's perspective while preserving much of the original dialogue. Wright
                                encouraged greater deviation from the text, including
                                changing the dynamics within the Bennet family. Wright and Moggach set the film in an
                                earlier period and avoided depicting a "perfectly clean Regency world", presenting
                                instead a "muddy hem version" of the time. It was
                                shot entirely on location in England on an 11-week schedule.[5][6] Wright found casting
                                difficult due to past performances of particular characters. The filmmakers had to
                                balance who they thought was best for each role
                                with the studio's desire for stars. Knightley was well known in part from her role in
                                the Pirates of the Caribbean film series, while Macfadyen had no international name
                                recognition.

                            <p class="card-text">It has been two and a half years since Naruto Uzumaki left
                                Konohagakure, the Hidden Leaf Village, for intense training following events which
                                fueled his desire to be stronger. Now Akatsuki, the mysterious organization of elite
                                rogue ninja, is closing in on their grand plan which may threaten the safety of the
                                entire shinobi world. Although Naruto is older and sinister events loom on the horizon,
                                he has changed little in personality—still rambunctious
                                and childish—though he is now far more confident and possesses an even greater
                                determination to protect his friends and home. Come whatever may, Naruto will carry on
                                with the fight for what is important to him, even at
                                the expense of his own body, in the continuation of the saga about the boy who wishes to
                                become Hokage.</p>

                                the Top Gun film series. Written by Ehren Kruger, Eric Warren Singer, and Christopher

                                hybrids called "avatars". Paraplegic Marine Jake Sully is sent to Pandora to replace his
