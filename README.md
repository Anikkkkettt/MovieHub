Follow these steps to make your very first pull request.

# But what if I don't know how to add cards?

Not everyone is aware of every tool present in the world no matter how easy or complex it is. It's also not necessary to know each and every tool out there. Use the code sample below to add your own card for your favourite Movie!

```html
<div class="col-lg-4 mb-4">
  <div class="card">
    <img class="card-img-top" src="[Link to Movie image]" alt="" />
    <div class="card-body">
      <h5 class="card-title">[Name of your favourite Movie]</h5>
      <p class="card-text">[Small Description about your Movie]</p>
      <a
        href="[Add the link to your GitHub Profile]"
        class="btn btn-outline-danger btn-sm"
        >Contributed by - [Add your GitHub Username/profile name]</a
      >
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

Copy this code and paste it in the index.html file to make your changes. Test it on your own system and then create a pull request.

> **Note**
> When adding a new card, prioritize saving your images in the /images folder for performance purposes. Please also use a recommended size of 688x1000 in JPG format.
